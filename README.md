# Good Deed
Good Deed is an online platform that connects passionate people and encourages collaboration on community building projects. We are a nonprofit, project-based social media network to fund and promote social impact projects through crowdsourcing. 

A user will be able to create an account and from there either join a project, develop a new project, or donate to any project whether in the form of money, materials, or time.

Each user -- donor or developer -- has an account with their profile consisting of the projects they have developed and donated to. Our numerical metrics of popularity is the number of projects and the impact made by a user, quantified by statistics from the projects the user has participated in.

## A user can:
- Register a profile
- Log in
- Edit their profile
- View other user's profile
- Create a project
- Add a project description to a new project
- Add a category to a new project
- Add information and requests to a new project
- View list of projects available
- Search a project
- Filter projects by category
- Participate in a project
- Donate to a project
